Project Overview

In this project, I built a comprehensive assembler from scratch â€” a fully functional tool capable of parsing assembly code, managing symbol and macro tables, and generating optimized machine code.
The assembler supports error detection, macro expansion, and validation of assembly directives, ensuring accurate translation from source code to machine instructions.

This project significantly deepened my understanding of computer architecture, low-level programming, and assembly language principles.
