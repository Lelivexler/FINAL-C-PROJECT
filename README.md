**In this project, I built a comprehensive assembler from scratch** —  
a fully functional tool capable of parsing assembly code, managing symbol and macro tables, and generating optimized machine code.

The assembler supports:

- ✔ Error detection  
- ✔ Macro expansion  
- ✔ Validation of assembly directives  

ensuring accurate translation from source code to machine instructions.

**This project significantly deepened my understanding of:**

- Computer architecture  
- Low-level programming  
- Assembly language principles
